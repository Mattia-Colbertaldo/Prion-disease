# Prion-disease
Implementation of a simulation of Prion spreading inside a human brain mesh using Gmsh, Deal.II Library and Paraview for the visualization of the results. To characterize the progression of misfolded proteins across the brain, the classical Fisherâ€“Kolmogorov equation for population dynamics is used together with an anisotropic diffusion model and simulate misfolding across a sagittal section and across the entire brain.
