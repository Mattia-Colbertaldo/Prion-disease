# Prion-disease
Implementation of a simulation of Prion spreading inside a human brain mesh using Gmsh, Deal.II Library and Paraview for the visualization of the results. To characterize the progression of misfolded proteins across the brain, the classical Fisherâ€“Kolmogorov equation for population dynamics is used together with an anisotropic diffusion model and simulate misfolding across a sagittal section and across the entire brain.

Our work takes its references from the article "Weickenmeier et al. - 2019 - A physics-based model explains the prion-like features of neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease" reported here.

src_with_integrals contains an implementation of the calculation of the integral of the variacle c(x,t) across the volume of the brain. A .csv file is created to plot the results on a graph using a Phyton script. It is put in another folder not to change the results about timing and performances of the standard implementation.
